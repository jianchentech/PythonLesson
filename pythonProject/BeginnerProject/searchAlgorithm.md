# Search Algorithm (Deadline: March 20 11:59PM, 2021):

### Binary search
this search algorithm takes advantage of a collection of elements 
that is already sorted by ignoring half of the elements after just one
comparison. Write a function which implements binary search. You may assume
that the input list will be sorted. Hint: this function is often written recursively.

```
1. Compare x with the middle element.
2. If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index.
3. Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half.
4. Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half.
```

### Linear search
Write a function which implements linear search. It should take a list and an element
as a parameter, and return the position of the element in the list. If the element is
not in the list, the function should raise an exception. If the element is in the list
multiple times, the function should return the first position.

```
1. Start from the leftmost element of list and one by one compare x with each element of the list.
2. If x matches with an element, return True.
3. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return False.
```
